<div></div>
<!-- Creates a "division" or section panel that is basically where you put every other elements in -->

<article></article>
<!-- Creates a sub division or "article" panels that contains independent information -->

<section></section>
<!-- Creates a section panel for grouping individual elements with similar information or attributes -->

<!--
     NOTE: General rule of thumb for these three elements - Basically all these three has the same function and literally looks the same
     with each other. But there are nuances to consider in using each one of them. Keep in mind, however, that these are just
     common practices with "some" degree of practicality, but really, you can just use only one of these three in an entire website 
     and it still works fine.

     Articles are individual information about "something". For instance, an entry of a show product in an online store contains
     information about that product alone. All that information can be inside an article.

     Sections are used to group articles with common attributes, traits or whatever. Say for instance there are now multiple
     articles of gucci, lebrons, umm crocs, and fila shoes in the online store. All of those articles can then be group into a single
     section of Shoes.

     Divs are basically the OG placeholder of elements. That's really all it does.

     Articles and Sections have "some" degree of practicality because search engines MAY prioritize looking for these in websites. But who
     fucking knows maybe it doesn't actually. In any case, again, try to keep this information as just a rule of thumb rather than
     a necessity.

    NOTE: you can also define an element's style by directly adding it in its attribute! 

    Example:
    <div style="color: blue;"> </div>

    ALL ELEMENTS in HTML have this attribute, so it can be applied to any of them, but do note, however, that this is usually 
    inefficient and should be used only in a sort of last-resort desperation.

CCS 101: FRAMEWORK FOR EVERY MODIFIERS
----------------------------

(element) [generic element] OR (element).(class) [generic element WITH the specified class] OR .(class) [any element with the the specified class] 
OR (element), (element) [multple generic elements] OR #(id) [any BUT ONLY ONE element with the specified id]
{
    Modifier: (attribute) OR (attribute) (attribute) (attribute)...
}

ALL STYLE MODIFIERS YOU CREATE MUST BE INSIDE ONE OF THESE FRAMEWORKS 

Example: 
    color: red   alone is wrong. 
    
    You need: 
    .test-class
    {
        color: red
    }   



BASIC SELECTOR FORMATS
----------------------------

element{} 
      
    These represent all the default elements that HTML provides. Using this an element for css would mean
    that you would inherit its styling.

.element{} 
      
    Notice the dot at the beginning. This represent the CLASS that the user created. Using this as an element for
    CSS would mean that any elements with this particular class name would inherit its styling. You can add classes
    to multiple other elements, and they will also inherit the same style.
            
        Example:
            <p class="test-class"></p> : p element is tagged with "test-class":
            <body class="test-class"></body> : body is also tagged with the same class and is modified with:
            
            .test-class
            {
                color: red;
            }  

#element{} 

    Notice the hash at the beginning. This represent the id that the user created. Same functionality as classes, but
    the rule of thumb is that you only use ids for SPECIFIC elements that require it, as ID tags can only be used with ONE element only.

        Example:
            <p id="test-class"></p> : P element is tagged with "test-id" and will be modified with:

            #test-class
            {
                color: red;
            }

            YOU CANNOT ASSIGN ANY OTHER ELEMENTS WITH THIS ID THEREAFTER. I mean, technically, you still can. Your website will still apply the
            styles of the elements with same ids, but, just consider it as a must do coding etiquette, because it really might screw some things up.


element :: (pseudo class) {} 
    
    This is called a pseudo class. This acts as an extention for the current styling of the particular element specified. This allows multiple
    stylings in an element in various situations. You don't have to classify an element with classes or id for stylings within this element
    to be inherited. The second "(pseudo class)" after element ":" is a parameter that indicates when the stylings are to be in effect.

-->

<!-- 
    NOTE: You can use a double OR single semicolon. Double is the updated (and cooler looking) look & standard, but either of which works 
    HOWEVER, it is good practice to only use :: for before and after, and : for everything else.
-->

<!--
    Pesudo Classes:

    : hover         - activates the styling of an element when a cursor is directly hovering within the element
    :: before       - does something BEFORE the element
    :: after        - does something AFTER the element
    
    :hover :: after - combo class that activates a styling after an element while a cursor is hovering it.


    Useless ish pesudo classes:

    ::first-letter  - Just edits the first letter of the text element
    :first-line     - Just edits the first line of the text element

    NOTE: You can only make one :: before and ::after pseudo class. You can't have ::after & :hover::after as well. Pick your poison.

    Selectors: Extended Version.

    h1 {}                       <=      Type Selector. Modifies the element with the same name

    #test {}                    <=      ID Selector. Modifies the element with the same ID name 
    
    .test {}                    <=      Class Selector. Modifies the element with the same class name

    h1, h2, #test, .test {}     <=      Combined Selector. Allows multiple Selector modifications

    div p {}                    <=      Descendant Selector. In this example, it only modifies all element p that is inside the element div.
    
    h1 .test {}                 <=      Another Descendant Selector. In this example, it only modifies all h1 elements with a test class.

    * {}                        <=      ALL Selector. Modifies literally every element in the website

    :not(h1) {}                 <=      NOT Selector. Modifies every element in the website EXCEPT the element mentioned (h1)

    div > p {}                  <=      Child Selector. Modifies its DIRECT CHILD only. For example:
                                        
                                        <div>
                                            <p>
                                                Hello           <=  In this code, p is direct child of div, so Hello is modified
                                            </p>
                                        </div>

                                        <div>
                                            <article>
                                                Sup
                                                <p>
                                                    Hello       <= In this code, p is direct child of article. Article, however, is he child of div,
                                                </p>               So article is modified instead, and Sup is modified
                                            </article>
                                        </div>

<!-- 
    NOTE: in all elements, they are all have either BLOCK properties or INLINE properties. Elements with block properties consumes the
    very left to the very right side of the browser page line (when its width is left by default) with its margin. Due to its nature, 
    it stacks other elements vertically (meaning you can't put elements on its side). Elements with inline properties DOES NOT consume
    spaces like blocks, and due to this, allows horizontal stacking (by default), and goes to the next line of the page only if it ran out
    of horizontal space. Also note that in inline blocks, they do not have height and width, and they will only have these properties based on
    how big the content they contain. If you assigned a height and width value in an inline element, it will be ignored.

    Block elements can have margins in ALL SIDES, but inline elements
    can only be assigned with margins ON THE LEFT AND RIGHT SIDES ONLY. 

    Visual representation of what's happening:

    | xxxxxxxxxxxxx     ->->->->->->->->        -Notice how BLOCK goes down (vertically) while consuming the entire right side with blank
    V xxxxxxxxxxxxx     ->->->->->->->->         spaces as their margin, represented in X.
    | xxxxxxxxxxxxx     ->->->->->->->->    
    V xxxxxxxxxxxxx     ->->->->->->->->        -Notice how INLINE goes left to right (horizontally), not wasting space, and only
    (BLOCK property)    (INLINE property)        moves to the next line after reaching the end of the right side

    Common block elements are div p bn , and common inline elements are imgs and spans

    THERE IS ALSO A THIRD TYPE of display property, which is a hybrid of the two. "inline-block" functions much like elements with inline
    properties, but with the added property of being able to have UPPER AND LOWER margins, like blocks. It also can now have a height and width,
    like a block
-->

float: (attribute)
<!-- Fixes the location of the element so it will "float" up beside with other elements -->
<!--
     NOTE: width must also be specified along with this element, otherwise, the browser will automatically fill the gap of the whole
     screen, making it impossible for other elements to float up since there is no space.

<!-- position Attributes: -->
<!-- static - the default position behavior of elements -->
<!-- 
            absolute - puts elements in an absolute top, left, right, or bottom property. Can potentially overlap other elements.
            Position is determined by first NON-STATIC element. As long as there's no elements with RELATIVE position
            before it, first statement applies
        -->
<!-- absolute sub-properties : top OR bottom, left OR right. (Attributes are only px & %) -->
<!-- fixed - fixes the position of the element in the SCREEN -->
<!-- 
                NOTE: the difference between absolute and fixed is that in absolute, the element is fixed in ONE SPOT OF A PAGE,
                given its defined postition, while  fixed is fixed in ONE SPOT. PERIOD. that means even if you scroll up or down, it will
                absolutely retain its position to the screen no matter what.
             -->
<!-- 
            relative - puts elements in an absolute top, left, right, or bottom property. Can potentially overlap other elements, similar to
            absolute. Position is determined by first STATIC element. As long as there's no elements with STATIC position before it,
            first statement applies.
